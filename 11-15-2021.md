# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- Choose and plan a database for SDC

## Action
- First consider if I should use an RDBMS or a NoSQL system
  - I'm going to use a RDBMS because there are a lot of relationships in the product data that would work a lot better with a relational database.
- Decide on a RDBMS to use.
  - I narrowed it down to MariaDB and Postgres as I want to learn a new database system. Postgres is more new so I'm going to go with Postgres. (There are more benefits and tradeoffs but mainly I made my choice based off of learning new technology that is widely used.) (See ticket for some benefits and tradeoffs)
- Model both the RDBMS (Postgres) and the NoSQL DB (MongoDB)
  - These look different but I wasn't sure how to model the NoSQL db to show the nested data. It looks like several tables but each table is actually just some nested data from the previous table.
  - I'm pretty happy with my Postgres model and even though I still have some questions on the specifics of it I think that I have developed the best model for space complexity at least. I feel like I don't really know enough about the databases innerworkings to start and optimize it for time complexity.

## Results
- I have two pretty different modals for the data that I can reference going forward.

# Core Concepts from Sprint
- There are a lot of things to take into consideration when choosing a database. Essentially what it comes down to is tradeoffs. RDBMS's are super secure as far as persisting data and keeping clean data but they are slow for reading (I think?) and NoSQL databases are a lot quicker but fall short if you are wanting to query you data and they can get out of sync easier (Maybe the proper term would be they get dirty easier)
