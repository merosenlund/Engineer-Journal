# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- My challenge for the day is going to be getting a form laid out.

## Action
- Get a diagram of what the requirements look like visually [Lucid Chart]()
- Based on the diagram get each element that is needed added to the form
- Figure out what additional elements will be needed to layout the form
- Implement the CSS for the layout reusing as many existing classes as possible.

## Results
- Laying out the form went very smoothly when I just treated it like any other dev problem. I have a skeleton for my form that I can work off and improve.




# What did I do today?
- We had our FEC Product Demos
- I had to do some troubleshooting before the demo and wasn't able to get some of the items implemented that I wanted to
- We had an intro to job search with CSM and I also went to an optional SEIR thing to get more information on being a seir.
