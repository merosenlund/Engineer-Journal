# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
Fixing ReviewsList layout after it broke using live data.

## Action
- Resize the thumbnails so they are a uniform size and so that they are small
- Add scroll functionality to the Review List so that instead of overflowing it scrolls.
- Set the max size of the widget to 95vh

## Results
- I'm happy with how the layout I have now.
