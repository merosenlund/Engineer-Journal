# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- Get request isn't returning information to the client in time for the first rendering so components can't render elements dependent on this information without using conditional rendering.

## Action
- Probably the best route to go and what we will do if we get time is to optimize our server code to return information as it comes in instead of waiting until it all comes in and returning a big chunk.
  - This will take some time and doesn't align with getting a MVP up in the time allowed.
- I tossed around the idea of having the server pre-fetch the information and have it on hand then only fetch again if it gets a request for a different product.
  - This seems very hokey and only solves the problem for our narrow developement environment. It wouldn't be a viable solution in the real world because we would have more than one user making requests for multiple different products.
- I thought about using conditional rendering in each individual component but that would add a lot of complexity to our code and would make maintenance a nightmare.
- Talking with my team we came up with moving the conditional rendering up to the ProductContext so it only renders the full webpage when it gets the information back. Otherwise it just renders a fragment.

## Results
- We have a MVP solution going. The whole webpage doesn't render as fast but when it does render it renders with all the correct information.
- We can make further improvements to the server to improve how quickly this renders. Potentially would could also make it so that each individual component renders when the info it needs is available. (Prioritizing the overview)
  - In order to do this though I would need to learn more about sending multiple responses from the server and how to handle that on the client side.
