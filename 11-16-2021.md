# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- Getting a Postgres database initialized

## Action
- Look into Postgres
  - It turns out that accessing postgres in the terminal is pretty similar to mysql.
  - The meaning of schema in postgres seems to have a different meaning than what it is in mysql.
- Develope a Postgres schema
  - [First version is in this Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/ba31fc91-13af-47e1-82f1-f13101c2258d/edit?page=0_0#)
  - I also attempted to use this web app recommended in learn to design my schema but it looks like it can only export MySQL (I probably should get better at creating database files from scratch.)
    - [SQL Designer](https://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/)
  - In looking for alternatives to the SQL Designer I stumbled across the knowledge that pgAdmin has functionality to create ERD's so I installed pgAdmin and created my final schema in there.
- Initialize the Postgres database using the designed schema
  - This was super easy using pgAdmin almost too easy.
  - I want to spend some time tomorrow making sure that if I need to do this from the terminal or from vs code by making my own files I can do this.

## Results
- I have a Postgres database set up that has the tables that I need.

  - I'm not sure how much I will do on this ticket because it seems like much of the data we have received is already clean and in the right shape.

  - I got a couple smaller tickets out of this bigger ticket.
  - I'm planning on looking some more into Sequalize tomorrow and also seeing if there is any reshaping of the data that I want to do.
