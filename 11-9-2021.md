# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- Getting the stars in the add review form to have an on hover effect and a on click effect
  - Because of how I initially set this component up I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to implement this functionality and that I was going to need to rewrite the component to have 5 separate elements instead of text.

## Action
- Gave it some thought instead of jumping to conclusion
- Figure out how I can calculate the mouse position based on the target element
  - This is done using `var rect = target.getBoundingClientRect()`
  - With the rect you can separate the rect.left from the clientx in order to get the mouses position on the x axis relative to the target
- A little further math I was able to convert this to a percentage and then to a 1 through 5 rating.
- I then store this rating in state and passed it into the Stars component.
- [MDN getBoundingClientRect docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect)

## Results
- I'm very happy that I was able to get a solution working with the star component that we already have. It has a nice on hover effect and it has a nice on click effect.


# What did I do today?
- Helped Yosef decomposing his toy problem and had a lot of fun doing it.


# Core Concepts from Sprint



# "Ah-ha" or Learning Moments
- TIL that you can use data-anything to store data in an HTML tag ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes))
  - To access the data in JS you use `DOMnode.dataset.anything`
  - In react to access it in a onClick handler I used `e.target.dataset.value` (I had `data-value` in the JSX element)
- When using useState you can't store an object, manipulate that object, and then try to reassign the manipulated object to state. React won't see anything as having changed and won't rerender. So you need to create a copy of the object, make changes and then reassign the state.
- React SyntheticEvent.target is a DOMnode.
  - I think that I already knew this on some level but never confirmed it.
- We learned a lot about AWS and infrastucture as a service
