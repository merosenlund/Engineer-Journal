# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- Setting up AWS and deploying our FEC project

## Action
- It went pretty smoothly
- Followed the slides
- Vinh did the driving and we helped / watched
- I'm going to deploy on my own and take better notes but that won't be until at least after we present FEC

## Results
- We were able to get our website deployed!


# What did I do today?
- Today seems to have been pretty spread out. We had a project management lecture from Annah and that was great. Had a couple meetings with Jonathan and I'm feeling a lot better after that. I should spend more time right now taking notes but I spent too much time after the alumni meeting. I don't regret it though, it was great.
