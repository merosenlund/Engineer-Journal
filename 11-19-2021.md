# A CAR a Day

## Challenge
- Get my queries set up
## Action
- A lot of this was me figuring out how to query using Sequelize
- Reference the docs a lot
- Use findAll if I needed to retrieve multiple records
- Use findByPk if I just needed to retrieve one item and knew it's id
- Figure out how to make all the promises work together and resolve to the final value that I needed

## Results
- I feel pretty confident in how sequelize works and I got the product queries and the styles queries complete. I just need to complete the related products queries now.
